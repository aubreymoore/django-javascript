# django-javascript
This Django website was built as a test to see how I could use a **javascript** called **dtree** available from http://destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/. Dtree provides a collapsible tree view. 

I had to make a minor edit to https://github.com/aubreymoore/django-javascript/blob/master/jstest/static/js/dtree.js to allow the script to serve some image files.
