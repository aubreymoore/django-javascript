# django-javascript
This Django website was built as a test to see how I could use a **javascript** called **dtree** available from http://destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/. Dtree provides a collapsible tree view. Note that I had to make a minor edit to **dtree.js** to allow the script to serve some image files.
